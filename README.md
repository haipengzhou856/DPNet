Igore this tiny, Î´ and rejected work. I'm trying to explore more solid framework for UDA with diffusion.

# update 2024/01
hi , this arxiv and simple work was rejected by MICCAI 2023 ðŸ˜‡. Wait for my future work and right now I'm trying to reconstruct it (I try to push myself to catch up ECCV24 âŒ›). 

I find my previous code is hard to reproduce, so this version I decide to unrelease the code to avoid missleading your guys.

I will make this DA work based on Diffusion more solid, turst me ðŸ˜Ž.

If you are intersted on my diffusion work, recently I have another one [STAN](https://haipengzhou856.github.io/paper_page/STAN/STAN.html) for shadow video segmentation via diffusion model and the code has been released. But the paper is not available due to the review roles. Maybe you can has a taste on it. Thx.

Thanks for attention :)
