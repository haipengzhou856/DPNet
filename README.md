Igore this tiny, Î´ and rejected work. I'm trying to explore more solid framework for UDA with diffusion.

# update 2024/01
hi , this arxiv and simple work was rejected by MICCAI 2023 ðŸ¥¹. Wait for my future work and right now I'm trying to reconstruct it (I try to push myself to catch up ECCV24ðŸ‘»). I will make this DA work based on Diffusion more solid. If you are interstes on my diffusion work, recently I have another one [STAN](https://haipengzhou856.github.io/paper_page/STAN/STAN.html) for shadow video segmentation and the code has been relesease but paper is not publical due to the review, and you can has a taste on it. Thx.

Thanks for attention :)
